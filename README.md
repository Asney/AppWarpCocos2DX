* Edit proj.android\jni\Android.mk file

Add AppWarp source c and cpp files so that they are built. For example something like this

```
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \
                   ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \
                   ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/appwarp.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/appwarp_extended.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/base64.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/cJSON.c \
                   ../../AppWarpX/HMAC_SHA1.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/requests.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/SHA1.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/socket.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/urlencode.cpp \
                   ../../AppWarpX/utilities.cpp
```

Also add the following at the end of your Android.mk file for curl

```
$(call import-module,cocos2dx/platform/third_party/android/prebuilt/libcurl)
```
* Build the native code

* Add the following to your manifest file

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
